## Project Introduction:

This mobile app concept is a further development of the [Apple of The Met](https://github.com/Xingwei726/Major-Studio-1/tree/master/Interactive), it works as the digital complement for the website. While previous website design presents users with a story about apple and redirect users to the online website. **This app helps visitors in the offline experience of navigating inside Met to find Apple.**
