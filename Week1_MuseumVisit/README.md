## Museum Visit

**Physical Collection Observations**
 - Ambiance Design( color palette /typefaces printed on the wall/ background music are very cohesive)
 - Diverse Collections+ Interactive Experience
 - Grouping logic of art pieces 
 - Physical booklets share similar quality
 - Small details are nice and thoughtful
 - Lack of direction guidance
 - Signage system isn't very obvious
 - Inconsistency in terms of using tag system

**Online Collection Observations**
 - Identity system feels very dynamic, it correlates with their offline branding as well. 
 - They have online catalogue magazine and annual report in magazine form as well.  
 - They display a variety of filters on top while being not too overwhelming.
 - Can’t apply multiple filters, such as ‘painting’+’Nepal’
 - Not all photos of artworks are in high resolution, not sure if it’s intentional or not.
 - Zoom in function isn’t very helpful

## Ideas & Sketches

**Idea 1 Composition & Geography**
*Main purpose: showcase what’s the relationship between geographic location and Himalayan paintings’ compositions.*

Himalayan 'style' art is primarily concerned with religious subjects and is recognizable through the use of composition, symbols and motifs.
Composition Types:
- Grouped Figures & Registers, Plus Archaic Architecture
- Registers
- Repeated Figure 
- Floating Figure Composition


**Idea 2 Visual Decoding Dictionary**
*Main purpose: to study if there is a pattern of using iconography in painting, sculpture, textile making throughout timeline.*

Himalayan art is mysterious and encrypted with cultural iconography, without help of explanation what we see in the museum might just be a magnificent painting, a marvelous sculpture but nothing else. A physical handout is helpful when information is limited, for non-experts, a digital tool might be easier.

**Idea 3 Glance of 15yrs**
*Main purpose: From a barney store to an art museum, this timeline of the museum showcases how it grows (October 2, 2004 ~2019, 15yrs, 180months ), visualize its input and output.*

The museum originated from a private collection of Himalayan art which Donald and Shelley Rubin had been assembling since 1974. Shifting and dynamic — represents the Rubin Museum’s mission to explore the big questions and ideas fundamental to human culture through a personal engagement with art. With more and more donations gathered, the museum is expanding its collections in order to provide a place for people to contemplate art. My third idea is to create a digital version of their annual report
